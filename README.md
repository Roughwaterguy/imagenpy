  Imagenpy is my fancy name for a Python based image downloader,
I used Unsplash's random function to fetch random photos and download them.
The purpose of this was for the user to not have to download stock
photos manually, instead, you get five stock images automaticly downloaded to
the images folder located in the same directory as the script (i guess you
could change it). 

HOW TO USE IT

Using Imagen is fairly simple, just click on the search.vbs file and
enter in your desired request. Once you have done this the python script
will download the images and prompt "Request complete". Now you check 
the images folder and your images will be there.

Please Note:
1. If you search the same thing twice it will overwrite the original images.

2. The included icon.ico is for a shortcut if you desire such a thing, just
   shortcut to search.vbs and change the icon in properties (or don't, whatever).

3. I do not have anything to do with Google's Imagen research project, this has
   no relation.
